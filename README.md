# Profile
This is a mini project for CBA Web UI Test.

I used angular4 to build up the application along with jquery and bootstrap.
This application is responsive and tablet friendly. It will show the navagation tabs in desktop mode and collapsable pane in tablet mode.
The profile is sorting by alphabet ascending based on the first name.
I wrote a pipe for replacing the new line in the bio string.
The application is tested via krama over the page title and the component.

I copied over the data into the component because I think this is a small project and no point to read it from the file. If it does, we usually read it from api via http and this need involve services and more testing.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Deployment

Run `ng build -prod` and copy dist folder over the www folder
